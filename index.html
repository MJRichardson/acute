			  <p>The ubiquity of HTML with the productivity of C#.</p>
		  </div>

		  <p>Acute is an MVC framework for developing client-side HTML applications in C#.  </p>

		  <p>Acute allows you to write MVC applications, using HTML for the views, and C# for the controllers, models, services, and whatever other components/patterns you desire. The C# portions are compiled into JavaScript, allowing your application to run in browsers everywhere.  </p>

		  <p>Acute aims to pair industrial-grade concepts (templates, controllers, dependency-injection, etc) with an industrial-grade language (C#). </p>

		  <p><span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> This project is in an early phase of development. If you wish to report issues or request features, please do so via GitHub. </p>

		  <h2>What?</h2>
		  <p>Acute is composed of two parts: a framework, and a compiler.</p>
		  <p>Acute.dll contains a model-view-controller framework. The concepts will be familiar if you have used any MVC previously, and are explained in more details in the <a href="concepts.html">Concepts</a> section. </p>
		  <p>When you build an Acute project, <em>two</em> compilers are invoked:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>The standard Microsoft C# compiler, which produces a DLL containing MSIL.</li>
			  <li>The Acute compiler, which produces a JavaScript file containing... JavaScript.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The standard compiler ensures your C# code is valid. The Acute compiler ensures you can reference it from an HTML page, and have it execute in any browser.</p>

		  <h2>Why?</h2>
		  <p>Because JavaScript.</p>
		  <p>Javascript is an immensely successful scripting language. <em>But</em>, it has a number of <del>flaws</del> <ins>features</ins> that make it <del>completely unsuitable</del> <ins>less than optimal</ins> for typical enterprise-application development. These are well-documented, and include:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><strong>Module/namespace system</strong> - There isn't one.</li>
			  <li><strong>Late-binding</strong> - I know in certain situations late-binding is very useful, but early-binding allows for static (i.e. compile-time) verification and vastly more powerful development tools. If only there was a language that offered both. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264741.aspx">Oh wait...</a> </li>
			  <li><strong>Type-system</strong> - Javascript's type-system is non-intuitive for someone with a 'traditional' O-O background (e.g. Java or C#). Its prototypal inheritance is poorly-understood and often mis-used. Its type-coercions are often <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">bizarre</a> (skip forward to approx 1:21 for the JavaScript section). </li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>Acute is targeted towards development teams using C# on the server. There is undeniable benefits in using the same language client-side, regardless of your opinion towards JavaScript. Each additional language in a solution brings the need for new conventions and tools; one more set of things a team must agree (or disagree) on. And there is simply only so many things we can devote the time to becoming expert in.</p>

		  <p>But we <em>need</em> JavaScript. It is the only language implemented in all popular web browsers. So we make the only reasonable choice: we use JavaScript for the part we want (ubiquity), discarding the part we don't (the actual language).</p>

		  <p>Javascript has become the assembly language of the web. Acute just takes this to its logical conclusion.</p>

		  <h2>How?</h2>
		  <p>Acute stands on the shoulders of two giants:</p>

		  <h3><a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a></h3>
		  <p>Acute is inspired by Angular. It borrows many concepts, and utilizes it for the implementation of much of the HTML-templating and DOM manipulation functionality.</p>

		  <h3><a href="http://www.saltarelle-compiler.com/">Saltarelle Compiler</a></h3>
		  <p>The Saltarelle-Compiler compiles C# into JavaScript. Without it, this project wouldn't have been possible (or at least would have taken a <em>lot</em> longer).</p>

		  <p>The <a href="setup.html">setup</a> page has details of what happens when you install the Acute NuGet package into your project. The <a href="walk-through.html">walk-through</a> shows a step-by-step introduction to building an Acute application.</p>
